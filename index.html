            Hello! My name is Charlie. My Korean name is No Eul, Mom just calls me Eul for short though. It apparently means Sunset. I am a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and I am 5 years old. I was born on October 4th 2016, and I came home on December 2nd 2016, when I was only 2 months old! I have white and brown fur. I love cuddles and chicken flavored anything. I eat basically anything that is edible, but I don't like tofu and blueberries. They don't really taste like anything. I don't like being home alone, and I don't like nose flicks. I love playing fetch, especially with rope ball toys. I am very spoiled and I like to be hand fed. If I am not I will bark at my food bowl until someone comes to hand feed me. I will also start barking and flip the bowl over if my water bowl is empty. I like to take naps for 16 hours a day, and I like it when my mom gives me a good stretch after my naps. I like pets, especially on my head and my chin. I also really like butt scratches cuz I can't reach that far. Please scratch my butt. Thanks.
